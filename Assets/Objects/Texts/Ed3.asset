  text: "1877, University of Santo Tomas(Philosophy and Letters, unfinished)\n\n------\n\nJos\xE9
    Rizal's time at the University of Santo Tomas (UST), where he pursued Philosophy
    and Letters, was a period of intellectual growth, burgeoning nationalism, and
    personal challenges. He enrolled in 1877, initially taking Cosmology, Metaphysics,
    Theodicy, and History of Philosophy. \n\n------\n\nHe later shifted to Medicine
    due to his mother's failing eyesight, but simultaneously continued his studies
    in Philosophy and Letters, eventually earning a Bachelor of Arts degree. \n\n------\n\nThis
    dual pursuit reflects his thirst for knowledge and his wide-ranging interests.\r\n"
