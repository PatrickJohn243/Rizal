  text: "1882 - 1885, Universidad Central de Madrid (Licentiate in Medicine)\n\n------\n\nHaving
    already begun his medical studies at the University of Santo Tomas in the Philippines,
    Rizal arrived in Madrid in 1882 to complete his Licentiate in Medicine at the
    Universidad Central de Madrid. He thrived in the more liberal and progressive
    academic environment, finding it a stark contrast to the antiquated methods back
    home. He excelled in his studies, demonstrating a keen intellect and dedication
    to his craft. Beyond medicine, he also pursued his artistic and literary interests,
    participating in student gatherings, writing essays and poems, and honing his
    skills in painting and sculpture. This period marked a significant intellectual
    awakening for Rizal, as he was exposed to European ideas about freedom, democracy,
    and human rights, concepts that would later shape his political thought and activism.
    He witnessed firsthand the disparities between the freedoms enjoyed in Europe
    and the oppressive conditions in his colonized homeland. These experiences fueled
    his growing sense of nationalism and his desire to advocate for reforms in the
    Philippines.\r\n\r\n------\n\nThis period wasn't solely focused on academics.
    Rizal experienced both intellectual exhilaration and the pangs of homesickness.
    He also faced financial difficulties, relying on remittances from his family
    which were often delayed or insufficient. This forced him to live frugally and
    sometimes even skip meals. Despite these challenges, Rizal remained committed
    to his studies and to his burgeoning advocacy for his countrymen. He began to
    contribute essays to publications like Diariong Tagalog, voicing his concerns
    about the Philippines and expressing his hopes for reform. The seeds of his future
    activism were sown during these formative years in Madrid.\n\n------\n\nAfter
    completing his Licentiate in Medicine in 1885, Rizal pursued specialized training
    in ophthalmology. He first went to Paris to work under the renowned ophthalmologist
    Dr. Louis de Wecker, honing his surgical skills and gaining valuable experience.
    This period marked a deepening of his medical expertise, particularly in the
    then-developing field of eye surgery. He was drawn to ophthalmology in part because
    his mother was suffering from failing eyesight, and he hoped to be able to treat
    her upon his return to the Philippines.\r\n\n------\r\n\r\nFollowing his time
    in Paris, Rizal moved to Heidelberg, Germany, to further his ophthalmological
    training at the University of Heidelberg. He worked at the eye clinic of Professor
    Otto Becker, further refining his skills and contributing to research. In Heidelberg,
    Rizal thrived both professionally and personally. He enjoyed the intellectual
    atmosphere of the university, formed close friendships with fellow scholars,
    and continued to develop his artistic talents. \n\n------\n\nHe completed his
    studies in Heidelberg in 1887, becoming a skilled ophthalmologist. While in Germany,
    Rizal completed his first novel, Noli Me T\xE1ngere, a scathing indictment of
    the abuses of the Spanish colonial system and the Catholic Church in the Philippines.
    The novel's completion marked a turning point in Rizal\u2019s life, shifting
    his focus from medicine to a more direct form of activism through his writing.
    He had equipped himself with both medical expertise and a powerful literary voice,
    tools he would utilize in his continuing fight for reform and eventually, independence
    for the Philippines.\r\n\n"
