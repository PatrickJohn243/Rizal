  text: "Early education under Justiniano Aquino Cruz in Bi\xF1an, Laguna.\r\n\n------\n\nAt
    the tender age of nine, Jose Rizal embarked on his formal education journey,
    leaving the familiar comforts of his family home in Calamba for Bi\xF1an, Laguna.
    He was placed under the tutelage of Maestro Justiniano Aquino Cruz, a renowned
    teacher in the town. \r\n\r\n------\n\nThis period laid the groundwork for his
    future academic pursuits, focusing on basic literacy, numeracy, and religious
    instruction. Though young, Rizal already displayed a keen intellect and an insatiable
    thirst for knowledge, often spending extra hours studying and engaging in intellectual
    discussions with his teacher and classmates. \r\n\r\n------\n\nHowever, this
    period was not without its challenges. He faced bullying from older students,
    an experience that instilled in him a strong sense of justice and a desire to
    defend the oppressed. He also learned valuable lessons about life beyond his
    sheltered upbringing, observing the social dynamics and disparities within the
    town. This early exposure to the realities of life outside his family's affluence
    would later influence his social and political views.\r\n"
