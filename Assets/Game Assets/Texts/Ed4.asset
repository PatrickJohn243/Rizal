  text: '1877 - 1882, University of Santo Tomas(Medicine, unfinished)


    ------


    After
    finishing a year in Philosophy and Letters, Rizal decided to shift to another
    course. Rizal''s shift to Medicine at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) was
    a significant turning point in his life, motivated primarily by his mother''s
    failing eyesight. While he continued his studies in Philosophy and Letters concurrently,
    this new path opened up new avenues of learning and experience, further shaping
    his worldview and future trajectory.

    

    ------


    Recognizing the
    limitations of the medical education available in the Philippines, Rizal began
    to make plans to study abroad. He understood that to truly excel in ophthalmology
    and contribute meaningfully to his country, he needed to seek more advanced training
    in Europe. This decision marked a pivotal moment in his life, setting the stage
    for his transformative experiences in Spain and beyond.
