  text: "Family of Rizal - Francisco Mercado Rizal\n\n------\n\nFrancisco Mercado,
    Jos\xE9's father, played a significant role in shaping his Jose Rizal\u2019s
    character. A man of integrity and moral fortitude, Francisco instilled values
    of honesty and hard work in his children. He supported Teodora's educational
    endeavors for their offspring and provided them with opportunities to learn beyond
    the confines of their rural environment. \n\n------\n\nHis influence complemented
    Teodora's nurturing spirit; together they created an atmosphere where education
    was paramount. Francisco's dedication to family and principles laid the groundwork
    for Jos\xE9's future activism. The Mercado household became a sanctuary of knowledge
    and enlightenment amidst the oppressive colonial regime.\r\n\r\n\n"
